Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)
About the internship
This 4-week program focused on providing practical skills in AI and Cloud Computing. The internship was structured with weekly virtual sessions, mentor guidance, and hands-on labs. The curriculum included:

Week 1: Internship Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, Artificial Intelligence.

Week 2: Hands-On Labs, and IBM cloud

Week 3 & 4: AI/ML experiments on the cloud, and a deep dive into AutoAI experiments on IBM Cloud.

Successful completion required active participation, completion of at least two courses on IBM SkillsBuild and a project from given problem statements for certificate.

Power System Fault Detection and Classification
Problem Statement
Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., voltage and current phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults). The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification, which is crucial for maintaining power grid stability and reliability.

Dataset
The dataset contains time-series or tabular records of voltage and current phasors, labeled according to the type of fault or normal condition. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-system-faults-dataset

Note: Dataset used in this project is either synthetic/simulated or obtained from a public source.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
IBM Cloud
ML Model
The model follows these steps:

Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization.
Feature Engineering – Extract statistical features from phasors.
Model Training – Using Decision Tree / Random Forest / SVM.
Evaluation – Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall.
Achieved an accuracy of approximately X% in fault classification.
