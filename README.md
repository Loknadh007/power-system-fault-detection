# power-system-fault-detection
This project uses machine learning to detect and classify power system faults using voltage and current phasor data. A Random Forest model is trained and deployed on IBM Watson Machine Learning for real-time fault prediction. It supports fault types like line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase, enhancing grid reliability.
